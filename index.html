        <h4 class="hythere" > Hi  there,</h4>

        <p> Adrin is a <strong class="highlight">George Brown student </strong> who loves candles, fashion
            and minimalism. A <em>native of Porto Alegre, Brazil,</em> she went to <a href="https://international.espm.br/">ESPM</a>
            university, and after graduating with a BA in <strong>marketing</strong> moved to
            Vancouver. After a few too many rainy days, she headed east and
            now calls Toronto home.</p>

        <h4 class="question center-this">What does this chick do????</h4>

        <p>In her spare time Adrin loves looking for gems at thrift stores. She
            also takes <a href=https://www.topfitnessmag.com/indoor-bike-reviews/what-is-spinning-class/>spinning classes</a> three times each week. She is not very
            good, but she feels like a badass after each class. When sheʼs not
            shopping or exercising, sheʼs working as a background extra for
            Netflix shows. Youʼll usually find Adrin hanging with her boyfriend
            <a href="https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/brad-troy.jpg" >Peter</a>, her best friend Gabby or her roommate Lexie.</p>
